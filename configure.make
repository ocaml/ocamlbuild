# It is important to distinguish OCAML_LIBDIR, which points to the
# directory of the ocaml compiler distribution, and OCAMLBUILD_LIBDIR,
# which should be the general library directory of OCaml projects on
# the user machine.
#
# When ocamlbuild was distributed as part of the OCaml compiler
# distribution, there was only one LIBDIR variable, which now
# corresponds to OCAML_LIBDIR.
#
# In particular, plugin compilation would link
# LIBDIR/ocamlbuild/ocamlbuild.cma. For an ocamlbuild distributed as
# part of the compiler distribution, this LIBDIR occurence must be
# interpreted as OCAML_LIBDIR; but with a separate ocamlbuild, it must
# be interpreted as OCAMLBUILD_LIBDIR, as this is where ocamlbuild
# libraries will be installed.
#
# In the generated configuration files, we export
# OCAMLBUILD_{PREFIX,BINDIR,LIBDIR}, which are the ones that should
# generally be used, as the shorted names {PREFIX,BINDIR,LIBDIR}.

# prefer $(git describe --always --dirty)
